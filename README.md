# vectorlib

To get familiar with vectors, matrices, and transformations, as well as build up a library for use in implementing your own ML algorithms, we will code up an implementation of vectors and linear transformations. We can then use these classes and their functions to write algorithms for nearest neighbour and regression algorithms. The class stubs for vector.py and transform.py have been provided for you.

## vector.py

`vector.py` implements a simple vector with a shape and a set of values. The underlying data structure used to store the values should be a multidimensional python array. 

## transform.py

`transform.py` implements a simple linear transformation with an underlying 2d python array to store the transformation values.
